## General 
I combined features of Grayscale Jekyll theme and the startbootstrap agency theme. I then decided I wanted to convert my one-page website into multiple pages, which I based on startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll by BlackrockDigital.

Please excuse my bad practice of using CSS in my HTML documents.

In head.htmls I have included google analytics tag.  I also bought my domain via google domains. 

Thanks to Sean Reedy, a computer scientist and good friend, for his help on this website!
