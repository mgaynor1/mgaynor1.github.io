		    		<h5>Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, is known to play an important role in the evolution and diversification of vascular plants. 
		    		I am interested in understanding the cascading effects of polyploidy on the ecology and evolution of angiosperms. 
		    		
		    		The effects of genome duplication at a community-level remains unclear, therefore with Drs. <a href="http://julienneng.weebly.com/">Julienne Ng</a> and <a href= "http://www.robertlaport.com/">Robert Laport</a> 
		    		we used a community phylogenetic approach to test (1) whether polyploid species are more distantly related to diploids
		    	    within the same community than co-occurring diploids are to one another and (2) whether polyploid species tend to exhibit greater ecological success than diploid species.
