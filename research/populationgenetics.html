		    		During my undergraduate, I worked with <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/hoffman/">Drs. Eric Hoffman</a> and Linda Walters on a project assessing the ability of restoration efforts to maintain genetic diversity within restored populations of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). We found that the current restoration efforts are able to maintain genetic diversity, therefore they ensure the evolutionary potential of these restoration populations.</h5>
