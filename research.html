		    		<h4 style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"> My research broadly encompasses evolution and ecology of Angiosperms. Through my undergraduate and graduate research experience, I have focused on population genetics and climatic niche evolution, as well as polyploidy evolution and ecology. Whole genome duplication, or polyploidy, is when additional copies of all chromosomes occur. Instead of having 2 copies of each chromosome (like humans), polyploids may have 3 to 96 copies of each chromosome (see 96 copies in <i>Ophioglossum reticulatum</i>)</h4>

		    		<h4 style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"> My current research focuses are on the cascading effects of whole genome duplication in flowering plants at multiple scales. My dissertation focuses on the persistence and formation of autopolyploid populations.

<!-- Polyploidy Evolution -->
<section id="polyploidy evolution" style="padding-top: 30px; padding-bottom: 50px;">
<div class = "container">
<div class = "row">
    <div class="caption" style="text-align:left; font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.5; color: #fa4616;"><b>Whole Genome Duplication</b></div>
    <hr style = "margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top-width: 2px;">

		     		 <h4 style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"><a style = "color: #fa4616;"><b>Polyploid Paradigm:</b> </a> Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication, is known to play an important role in the evolution and diversification of vascular plants. So far, most research has shown that whole genome duplication alone does not lead to a single set of expectations (other than maybe the nucleotypic effect), instead there are dynamic ecological or evolutionary consequences. The search for general patterns or trends associated with polyploidy events still remains â€“ and is a particularly interesting topic to pursue. </h4>
	
		    		<h4 style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"> At a community level, the effects of genome duplication remains unclear, therefore with Drs. <a href="http://julienneng.weebly.com/">Julienne Ng</a> and <a href= "http://www.robertlaport.com/">Robert Laport</a> 
		    		we used a community phylogenetic approach to began to unravel the influence of genome duplication in communities of Rosaceae and Brassicaceae species. We tested (1) whether polyploid species are more distantly related to diploids
		    	    within the same community than co-occurring diploids are to one another and (2) whether polyploid species tend to exhibit greater ecological success than diploid species. We did not find a consistent pattern, suggesting whole genome duplication impact on community structure may not be very black and white.
		  			</h4>

		  			<h4 style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"> Zooming in, I am also interested in understanding the repercussions of whole genome duplication on cellular and gene level dynamics, since this would allow insight on the cascading ecological and evolutionary consequences associated with polyploidy. After a polyploidy event occurs, duplicated biosynthetic pathway genes may alter plant secondary metabolite production, thus influencing plant defense. With Simone Lim-Hing and Chase Mason, we investigated how polyploidy affects the composition and abundance of all classes of secondary metabolites in non-cultivated species. Again, we found that no consistent effect.

					<h4  style= "color: #000000; text-transform: none; font-weight: 400;"><a style = "color: #fa4616;"><b>Mixed-ploidy species:</b> </a> Historically, it was believed that a tetraploid had to outcompete its diploid progenitor to persist. A tetraploid formed, spread, and caused the diploid to be geographically restricted and rare (Stebbins, 1947, 1971). We now know that closely related polyploids and their diploid progenitors can both remain extant.

            During my undergraduate, I worked with <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/hoffman/">Drs. Eric Hoffman</a> and Linda Walters on a project assessing the ability of restoration efforts to maintain genetic diversity within restored populations of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). We found that the current restoration efforts are able to maintain genetic diversity, therefore they ensure the evolutionary potential of these restoration populations.

            <br>
            Genetic diversity can also give insight into the history of those populations...
